README: 

Photoshop Plug-in for converting a fishyey image 
to square for 3dcg texture, made by 
Hirofumi Inomata, (C) 2003

I disclose AS-IS, only a main part, "do.c", for the plug-in,
with BSD License. And it had included some flugments 
with cut & try, also. Enjoy It!

Sorry, I can't disclose parts for a Adobe Photoship 
plug-in program interface, because of Adobe NDA.

Thank you and Enjoy it!
